# Precursor image demo

Demonstrates how Precursor images in a Github issue, PR, or Readme will update on refresh.

Works great for infrastructure diagrams, wireframes, and illustrations of complex ideas.

Just add ".svg" or ".png" to the end of any doc url to export your doc as an image. 

Make a change to the doc below, then come back here and refresh to see your changes.

Note: we made the doc read-only for a bit to cut down on the vandalism. We'll try making it public again tomorrow. In the meantime, you can try it out on the issue https://github.com/PrecursorApp/image-refresh-demo/issues/1
